# isiCNI Comp Neuro Imbizo 2018 -- Reinforcement Learning Tutorial

This repository contains the problem set and code for a tutorial given at the 2018 Imbizo Summer School in Cape Town, South Africa. It contains the following:
- rl_tutorial_updated.pdf: tutorial slides
- rl_problemsheet_updated.pdf: contains tutorial problem set; primarily coding problems based on a GridWorld RL environment.
- code folder: contains baseline code for GridWorld, plotting functions, etc., in order to follow along with the problem sheet; some function implementations are missing as part of the tutorial.
- code_solutions folder: contains complete code and test files as answers to all tutorial problems; solution files ('test_*') are meant to be run as python scripts.

This tutorial was based on and adapted from material in David Silver's 2015 UCL course (https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/) as well as the Sutton & Barto book (http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html).
